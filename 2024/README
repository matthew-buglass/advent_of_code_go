# 2024

in 2024, I want to get better with go and try to parallelize each question as much as possible, even if it's redundant to do so (especially for the early ones).

## Question 1
```
run(part1, input-example) returned in 521Âµs => 11
run(part1, input-user) returned in 4ms => 1320851
run(part2, input-example) returned in 0s => 31
run(part2, input-user) returned in 1ms => 26859182
```
