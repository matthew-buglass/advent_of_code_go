# 2024

in 2024, I want to get better with go and try to parallelize each question as much as possible, even if it's redundant to do so (especially for the early ones).

## Question 1
```
run(part1, input-example) returned in 521µs => 11
run(part1, input-user) returned in 4ms => 1320851
run(part2, input-example) returned in 0s => 31
run(part2, input-user) returned in 1ms => 26859182
```

## Question 2
```
run(part1, input-example) returned in 516µs => 2
run(part1, input-user) returned in 4ms => 282
run(part2, input-example) returned in 538µs => 4
run(part2, input-user) returned in 3ms => 349
```

## Question 3
```
run(part1, input-example) returned in 326µs => 161
run(part1, input-user) returned in 5ms => 190604937
run(part2, input-example) returned in 57µs => 48
run(part2, input-user) returned in 4ms => 82857512
```

## Question 4
```
run(part1, input-example) returned in 1ms => 18
run(part1, input-user) returned in 265ms => 2591
run(part2, input-example) returned in 94µs => 9
run(part2, input-user) returned in 28ms => 1880
```

## Question 5
```
run(part1, input-example) returned in 314µs => 143
run(part1, input-user) returned in 5ms => 4766
run(part2, input-example) returned in 175µs => 123
run(part2, input-user) returned in 1ms => 6257
```
